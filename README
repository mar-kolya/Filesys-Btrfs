Filesys-Btrfs

Simple wrapper around Linux C<btrfs> util. Btrfs util is used to
manage btrfs filesystem: manage snapshots, subvolumes and etc.  Only
subset of C<btrfs> options is supported (hopefuly it is useful
subset).

For more information about C<btrfs> util please see L<btrfs> manpage.

B<WARNING> This module is hightly experimental (as btrfs itself). API
can change in the future.

Example:

    use Filesys::Btrfs;

    my $btrfs = Filesys::Btrfs->new($mount_point);
    $btrfs->subvolume_create('subvolume');

	perl Makefile.PL

Note: due to nature of the module most of tests cannot be run if user is not root,
'sudo make test' should make sure that module is working fine.
